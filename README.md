# Extended-Console
This small little c# class library provides a layer over the existing System.Console, allowing you to easily use it for multi-threaded console applications. It allows for printing while letting the user type in text, without disrupting them, all the while keeping the same function functionality as the most used System.Console class.

This library also allows for easy logging of anything that is printed or entered into the console by means of a a text logger interface, which the user is required to implement themselves. This allows for easily making logbooks of whatever the application is sending to the console, as well as input.

Repository is provided with a demo solution.
